    "# Unit 3 AP CSP Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Variables & Assignments\n",
    "- Variables are like containers that hold information\n",
    "- You can change what's stored in a variable\n",
    "- Use the symbol to put a value into a variable\n",
    "- Give variables names that make sense so you remember what they're for\n",
    "- Example: age 15 means the variable \"age\" now holds 15\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Data Abstraction\n",
    "- Lists let you store a bunch of things in one place instead of making tons of separate variables\n",
    "- Makes it way easier to organize data\n",
    "- You can access items in a list by their position number\n",
    "- Lists are just a simpler way to handle lots of information at once\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "- You can do math in code just like regular math (adding, subtracting, etc.)\n",
    "- MOD gives you the remainder when you divide\n",
    "- Order of operations still matters (multiply/divide before add/subtract)\n",
    "- The computer calculates everything and gives you one answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Strings\n",
    "- Strings are just text in quotes\n",
    "- You can combine strings together (like \"hello\" + \"world\")\n",
    "- You can grab part of a string if you need to\n",
    "- Each letter in a string has a position number\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.5 Boolean Expressions\n",
    "- These are statements that are either TRUE or FALSE\n",
    "- You use them to compare things (is this equal to that? is this bigger?)\n",
    "- AND, OR, and NOT help you combine conditions\n",
    "- These are super important for making decisions in code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.6 Conditionals\n",
    "- IF statements let your program make choices\n",
    "- \"IF this is true, do this thing\"\n",
    "- IF-ELSE gives you a backup plan if the condition is false\n",
    "- Only one part of the IF-ELSE will actually run\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.7 Nested Conditionals\n",
    "- This is basically putting an IF statement inside another IF statement\n",
    "- Lets you check multiple things in order\n",
    "- Can get confusing if you do too many layers\n",
    "- Helps make more specific decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.8 Iteration\n",
    "- Iteration is just a fancy word for repeating code (loops)\n",
    "- REPEAT lets you do something multiple times without writing it over and over\n",
    "- REPEAT UNTIL keeps going until something becomes true\n",
    "- Be careful not to make loops that never stop (infinite loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.9 Developing Algorithms\n",
    "- An algorithm is just the steps to solve a problem\n",
    "- Break big problems into smaller chunks\n",
    "- You use sequences (order), decisions (IF), and loops (REPEAT)\n",
    "- Test your algorithm to make sure it actually works\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.10 Lists\n",
    "- Lists can change size - you can add or remove items\n",
    "- You can add things to the end, insert in the middle, or remove stuff\n",
    "- Going through each item in a list is called traversing\n",
    "- Lists make it easy to work with a bunch of related data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.12 Calling Procedures\n",
    "- Procedures are chunks of code you can reuse by calling their name\n",
    "- Instead of writing the same code over and over, just call the procedure\n",
    "- Procedures can take inputs (parameters) to work with different values\n",
    "- Makes your code cleaner and easier to read\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.13 Developing Procedures\n",
    "- When you make a procedure, you give it a name and tell it what to do\n",
    "- Parameters are the inputs you give the procedure\n",
    "- Procedures can send back an answer (return value)\n",
    "- Each procedure should do one specific job\n",
    "- Writing what the procedure does helps you remember later\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.15 Random Values\n",
    "- RANDOM gives you an unpredictable number in a range you choose\n",
    "- Good for games, simulations, or when you need something random\n",
    "- The computer doesn't actually pick truly random numbers, but close enough\n",
    "- Useful when you want variety or to test things\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency\n",
    "- Some ways of solving a problem are faster than others\n",
    "- Efficiency is about how much time or memory your code uses\n",
    "- When you have more data, efficiency matters more\n",
    "- Sometimes you compare different solutions to see which is better\n",
    "- Doesn't have to be perfect, just understanding that some methods are quicker"

    "# Trimester Retrospective: My Growth This Year\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looking Back: How I've Changed\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the year, I honestly didn't know much about computer science. I could follow tutorials and copy code examples, but I didn't really understand why things worked. If something broke, I'd be pretty lost. Now, things are different. I can actually debug problems on my own, I understand what's happening behind the scenes, and I can explain technical concepts without stumbling over my words. It's wild to look back and see how much I've learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sprint Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint 1: Tools and Environment\n",
    "Learning about tools like Git, development environments, and deployment was kind of boring at first, not gonna lie. I just wanted to code! But now I get why it matters. Knowing how to use version control properly, set up my workspace, and manage dependencies makes everything so much easier. I used to think these were just extra steps, but now I realize they're what separate messy projects from professional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint 2: Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python\n",
    "This sprint was where things started clicking. Learning JavaScript and Python side-by-side helped me see patterns that work across different languages. I finally understood things like how loops really work, what data structures to use when, and how to work with APIs. There were definitely moments where I felt confused, but then something would click and I'd be like \"ohh, that's how that works!\" Those moments kept me going.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint 3: West Coast Travel / Digital Famine\n",
    "This project was the hardest but also the most fun interesting part. Taking everything I learned and actually building something real was tough. I had to figure out how to connect different APIs, make sure users could log in. I worked on Submodule 4, generating the itinerary and learnt how the prompts used influence the quality of AI's output I got help from my peers to complete this. "
